My name is **Joshua Izquierdo** and I am currently a senior at **Florida International University**. I am actively pursuing my **Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science**. The programming language I currently work with is Java, but I am in the process of transitioning to Python. My programming journey began with taking a computer science class in high school and I have continued on that path.

## Technical Skills
- Programming
  * Originally worked with **Java**; actively use **Python** to develop programs.
  * Used **Swift** to develop applications with XCode.
- Front-end development
  * Created **user interfaces** for academic projects.
- Back-end development
  * Worked with libraries such as **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to create and display visual representations of data in an application.
- Group work
  * Collaborated with teams to develop applications for academic projects.
- Project Management
  * Applied the **Scrum framework** to organize tasks and track project progression.
  * Utilized GitHub issues and project boards for task management and collaboration.
## Interests
- Front-end Software Engineering
  * I enjoy the creative process of developing an application's user interface and functionality. Actualizing ideas into functional applications is the most rewarding aspect for me.
- Video Game Development
  * Ever since I was little, I loved to play video games all the time. I am fascinated by the creativity, design, and problem-solving that goes into developing video games.
## Current Projects
- [Adoptly](https://github.com/COP-4655-Group/Adoptly)
- [Bird Observer](https://github.com/Joshua230670/class-project-HCL)
- An Undertale Battle Simulator built with the **Godot** engine.
## Career Goals
Currently, I am pursuing a **Software Engineering internship** before graduating F.I.U. I am reviewing core computer science concepts such as the fundamentals of programming, data structures, algorithm techniques, and database management to build the necessary skills and gain the knowledge I need to become a professional in the field. After graduating, I plan on beginning my career as a **Junior Software Engineer.**
