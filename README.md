My name is **Joshua Izquierdo** and I am currently a senior at **Florida International University**. I am **21 years old** and actively pursuing my **Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science**. The programming language I currently work with is Java, but I am in the process of transitioning to Python. My programming journey began with taking a computer science class in high schhol and I have continued that path ever since.

## Technical Skills
- Programming
  * Originally worked with **Java** and now use **Python** actively to develop programs.
  * Used **Swift** to develop applications with XCode.
- Front-end development
  * Created **user interface** for a personal projcet application.
- Back-end development
  * Worked with APIs such as **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to create and display visual representations of data in an application.
- Group work
  * Worked with several groups and individuals to develop applications for projects.
- Project Management
  * Applied the **Scrum framework** to manage work groups and track project progression.
  * Utilized GitHub to create issues and assign them to project members.
## Interests
- Front-end Software Engineering
  * The reason I state that front-end software engineering is one of my interests, is because I find enjoyment in the creative process of developing an application's user interface and functionality. Actualizing ideas for applications, planning the development, and constructing the app whether from scratch or from the pillars of another is an accomplishing experience.
- Video Game Development
  * Ever since I was little, I loved to play video games all the time. They are the main reason why I became interested in programming as the idea of being able to create such masterpieces in story-telling and gameplay is fascinating.
